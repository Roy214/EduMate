        "example": "The probability of rolling a 6 on a fair 6-sided die is 1/6 ‚âà 0.1667."
    },
    "Independent & Dependent Events": {
        "definition": "Independent events do not affect each other‚Äôs outcomes, while dependent events do.",
        "example": "Flipping a coin twice (independent) vs. drawing two cards from a deck without replacement (dependent)."
    },
    "Conditional Probability": {
        "definition": "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.",
        "example": "If a bag has 5 red and 3 blue balls, and you draw a red first, the probability of drawing another red changes."
    },
    "Bayes' Theorem": {
        "definition": "Bayes' Theorem describes how to update probabilities based on new evidence.",
        "example": "If a test for a disease is 90% accurate but the disease is rare (1% of people), the probability of having the disease given a positive test is lower than 90%."
